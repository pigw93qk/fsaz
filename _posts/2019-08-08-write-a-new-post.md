This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the _Chirpy_ template, and it's worth reading even if you've used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.

## Naming and Path

Create a new file named `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION`{: .filepath} and put it in the `_posts`{: .filepath} of the root directory. Please note that the `EXTENSION`{: .filepath} must be one of `md`{: .filepath} and `markdown`{: .filepath}. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin [`Jekyll-Compose`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) to accomplish this.

## Front Matter

Basically, you need to fill the [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) as below at the top of the post:

```yaml
---
title: TITLE
date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT
categories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]
tags: [TAG]     # TAG names should always be lowercase
---
```

> The posts' _layout_ has been set to `post` by default, so there is no need to add the variable _layout_ in the Front Matter block.

### Timezone of Date

In order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the `timezone` of `_config.yml`{: .filepath} but also provide the post's timezone in variable `date` of its Front Matter block. Format: `+/-TTTT`, e.g. `+0800`.

### Categories and Tags

The `categories` of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in `tags` can be zero to infinity. For instance:

```yaml
---
categories: [Animal, Insect]
tags: [bee]
---
```

### Author Information

The author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the _Front Matter_ , they will be obtained from variables `social.name` and the first entry of `social.links` of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:

Adding author information in `_data/authors.yml` (If your website doesn't have this file, don't hesitate to create one).

```yaml
<author_id>:
  name: <full name>
  twitter: <twitter_of_author>
  url: <homepage_of_author>
```
{: file="_data/authors.yml" }


And then use `author` to specify a single entry or `authors` to specify multiple entries:

```yaml
---
author: <author_id>                     # for single entry
# or
authors: [<author1_id>, <author2_id>]   # for multiple entries
---
```


Having said that, the key `author` can also identify multiple entries.

> The benefit of reading the author information from the file `_data/authors.yml`{: .filepath } is that the page will have the meta tag `twitter:creator`, which enriches the [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started#card-and-content-attribution) and is good for SEO.

## Table of Contents

By default, the **T**able **o**f **C**ontents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to `_config.yml`{: .filepath} and set the value of variable `toc` to `false`. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post's [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```yaml
---
toc: false
---
```

## Comments

The global switch of comments is defined by variable `comments.active` in the file `_config.yml`{: .filepath}. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.

If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the **Front Matter** of the post:

```yaml
---
comments: false
---
```

## Mathematics

For website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won't be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:

```yaml
---
math: true
---
```

After enabling the mathematical feature, you can add math equations with the following syntax: 

- **Block math** should be added with `$$ math $$` with **mandatory** blank lines before and after `$$`
- **Inline math** (in lines) should be added with `$$ math $$` without any blank line before or after `$$`
- **Inline math** (in lists) should be added with `\$$ math $$`

```markdown
<!-- Block math, keep all blank lines -->

$$
LaTeX_math_expression
$$

<!-- Inline math in lines, NO blank lines -->

"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, $$ LaTeX_math_expression $$ consectetur adipiscing elit."

<!-- Inline math in lists, escape the first `$` -->

1. \$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$
2. \$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$
3. \$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$
```
